# Python Practice and Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of practice materials and mini projects that I have created or undertaken while learning Python. It serves as a personal learning archive, showcasing various concepts and techniques I have explored.

## Contents

1. **Practice Exercises**: These are smaller, focused exercises designed to help reinforce specific Python concepts such as data structures, functions, and more.

2. **Mini Projects**: These are slightly larger projects that integrate multiple concepts and demonstrate more complex problem-solving skills. Examples might include simple games, data analysis tasks, web scraping, and other practical applications.

3. **Notes and Resources**: This section includes any additional notes, code snippets, or external resources that were particularly useful during the learning process.
